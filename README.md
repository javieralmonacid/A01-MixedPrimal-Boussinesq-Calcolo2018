Modelling Natural Convection with FreeFem++
=================================================

Natural convection is a heat transfer process that is present in our everyday life: from the cooling of little electronic devices, to indoor climate systems, to environmental transport problems.

## Mathematical Model

The model is originally given by the equations of conservation of mass, momentum an energy, coupled by means of the Boussinesq approximation
